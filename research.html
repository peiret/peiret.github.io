                <h3>Multirate Co-Simulation of Hydraulic Systems</h3>
                <p>Developing coupling strategies for multirate co-simulation of multi-physics systems with particular interest in hydraulic-actuated machines. The fast dynamics of hydraulic systems requires simulation time-step sizes smaller than that of other mechanical systems. Reduced-order models can give a physics-based prediction of the mechanical system when co-simulating hydraulic subsystems.</p>

                <h3>Contact and friction modelling</h3>
                <p>Contact is a common phenomenon in the physical world, but simulating systems with contact efficiently can be challenging, especially if we consider friction. Transitions from static to kinetic friction (stick-slip) as well as jamming (as in the Painlev&eacute; paradox) are some of the complex phenomena that are hard to capture numerically in simulation.</p>
